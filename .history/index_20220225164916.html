            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I am a front-End Developer student at CodeSpace Academy. I have completed their Web Design course, and I am currently enrolled in a Front-End Development course.</li>
                    <li>My first full time job after my Marketing Management course was working as an ecommerce website manager / shop assistant. Delivering a great customer experience was my driving force when I took on that role. I was in the position where I needed to deliver a good customer experience both in-store, and on the ecommerce website. This is where my love for a good customer experience caught fire.</li>
                    <li>I was offered a full-time job in the company’s IT department, which I accepted. I started my new role as an IT technician where I have been working for 5 years, offering a wide range of IT services, both internally and to external clients.</li>
                    <li>In 2021, after much research, I decided to study Web Design at CodeSpace Academy. I immediately knew that I had found my “career calling”. Anyone in the tech industry will know the unyielding urge to solve complex problems and to tackle new challenges. Coding is the ever-growing complex world of computer languages and design that I have been waiting to discover. I go to bed thinking of how I can improve on my current projects, and I wake up ready to learn something new. </li>
                    <li> I am a teacher at heart and have enjoyed the opportunity to share what I learn with my fellow students. I use the class Slack channel to share any new insights that I’ve learned and have also had one-on-one Zoom sessions to assist other students when they are stuck.
                    </li>
                    <li style="color: green;">I believe that one of the best ways to learn is to teach others - it gives me great satisfaction to make one more “happy customer”.</li>
