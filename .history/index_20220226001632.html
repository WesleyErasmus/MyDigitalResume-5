            <h1 id="about">More about me</h1>
            <p>
                I am a front-End Developer student at CodeSpace Academy. I have completed their Web Design course, and I
                am currently enrolled in a Front-End Development course. </p>

            <p>My first full time job after my Marketing Management course was working as an ecommerce website manager /
                shop assistant. Delivering a great customer experience was my driving force when I took on that role. I
                was in the position where I needed to deliver a good customer experience both in-store, and on the
                ecommerce website. This is where my love for a good customer experience caught fire.</p>

            <p>I was offered a full-time job in the company’s IT department, which I accepted. I started my new role as
                an IT technician where I have been working for 5 years, offering a wide range of IT services, both
                internally and to external clients.</p>

            <p>In 2021, after much research, I decided to study Web Design at CodeSpace Academy. I immediately knew that
                I had found my “career calling”. Anyone in the tech industry will know the unyielding urge to solve
                complex problems and to tackle new challenges. Coding is the ever-growing complex world of computer
                languages and design that I have been waiting to discover. I go to bed thinking of how I can improve on
                my current projects, and I wake up ready to learn something new.</p>

            <p>I am a teacher at heart and have enjoyed the opportunity to share what I learn with my fellow students. I
                use the class Slack channel to share any new insights that I’ve learned and have also had one-on-one
                Zoom sessions to assist other students when they are stuck.</p>

            <p class="green-text">I believe that one of the best ways to learn is to teach others - it gives me great
                satisfaction to make one more “happy customer”.</p>
            </p>
